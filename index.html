    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Whole Apples (Honey Crisp and/or Granny Smith preferred)</li>
        <li>A Bag of Small Marshmallows</li>
        <li>Peanut Butter (Smooth or Chunky)</li>
        <li>Optional: Chocolate or Strawberry Syrup</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut off the stem and root ends of the apple.
            This will help keep unnecessary foliage out of your
            treat.
        </li>
        <li>Cut the apple into 5 vertical segments around half
            an inch thick. This should leave you with 5
            saucer-shaped apple slices.
        </li>
        <li>Cut the apple saucers in half, to create "lips"
            for the smile of your spooky apple smiles.
        </li>
        <li>Cover one side of each apple slices with your 
            peanut butter of choice. Dont be afriad to be 
            generous if you or your kid love peanut butter!
        </li>
        <li>Place 4 to 5 marshmallows on top of the peanut
            butter covered side of the apple slice to create
            a "teeth" effect.
        </li>
        <li>Finish off by stacking another apple slice on top,
            with the peanut butter covered side facing the uncovered
            marshmellows.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p> Voila! Now you have Spooky Halloween Apple Smiles!</p>
    <p>As a bonus, you may dip the spooky smiles in your
        preferred syrup to give them a "bloody" effect for
        added spookiness!
